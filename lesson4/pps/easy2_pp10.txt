benefits to using OOP:

y   Creating objects allows programmers to think more abstractly about the code they are writing.
n   Objects are represented by nouns so are easier to conceptualize.
m   It allows us to only expose functionality to the parts of code that need it, meaning namespace
    issues are much harder to come across.
y   It allows us to easily give functionality to different parts of an application without
    duplication.
n   We can build applications faster as we can reuse pre-written code.
y   As the software becomes more complex this complexity can be more easily managed.
