- within an instance method, 'self' refers to the calling obj, in this case small_car
- self.class rtns the class of the calling obj; in this case small_car is an instance of the Car class, so
  Car is rtn'd
- so,
  puts "I am a #{self.class} and going super fast!"
  outputs
  "I am a Car and going super fast!"
