21 is a two-participant game (Player and Dealer).  Each participant is dealt 2 cards (one face-up,
one face-down) from a deck of 52 cards.  Each participant can see their own cards and the face-up
card of their opponent.

Bust: If a participants cards total > 21, the participant has busted.

Player's turn:  The Player either stays (no more cards) or hits (is dealt another card from the
deck).  If the Player busts, the game is over.  Otherwise, once the Player stays, it is the
Dealer's turn.

Dealer's turn:  The Dealer must hit until the total of their cards is >= 17.

Winner evaluation:  If someone busts, the other participant wins.  Otherwise, the participant
whose card total is closest to 21 wins.  Otherwise, it's a tie.
